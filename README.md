Project for TE 303

Product Description:
UV Sensor Portable Device

UV sensor portable device for Adafruit Circuit Playground Express board. This project uses an Adafruit analog UV light sensor breakout (GUVA-S12SD).  The project has two modes. When the slide switch is on the left, it becomes an instant UV meter that lights up the neopixels based on the current measure of UV index. The second mode works when the switch is on the right; it acts as a cumulative UV exposure mode. It continuously tracks how much UV exposure the user has and plays an alarm when the user has exceeded their daily safe dose of UV. Currently, that mode is a demo to present it in class. 


Required parts:
This project will utilize the Circuit Playground Express, connected to a power source. Alligator clips will be used to connect to the connection pads; the jumper wires will be connected into the breadboard that is connected to the Adafruit Analog UV Light Sensor
